The course uses a variety of data examples, R packages and practical sheets. The easiest way of downloading and installing all dependencies is first to install the R package associated with this course, named 'BristolVis'. It can be simply installed by running the following code lines into your R session.

drat::addRepo("statcourses")
install.packages("BristolVis")
```
